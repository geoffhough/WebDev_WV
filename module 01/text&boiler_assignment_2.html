    <h1>This is the Main Heading of a boilerplate html doc</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This text is below an Horizontal Rule, and might be an introduction to the
      rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into
      several sub-headings. Oscar Wilde is QUOTED as saying that
      <q>sub-headings are great, and so are symantec markups</q>.

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure
      of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or
      lower-level headings). Another Sub-Heading
    </p>
    <h3>
      Here you can see another sub-heading. It is 3<sup>rd</sup> level, and
      contains to SUPerscipt.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is not <em>another</em> sub-heading, but still has some EMphasis
      added. But should this be a heaading? Probably not. Too much info/text
      now. A chemical compound is C0<sub>2</sub>. Note the SUBscript!

<!--this is a comment field.   also, this html document is a boilerplate that was an option
in VS Code that appeared when typing "html" into first line of the document.

Introduced "span" but not sure what it really is.

Instead of bold and italicized, use strong and em.  Better for ADA purposes. 
  Also better to use sub and sup for ADA purposes.
  
  Use <br> sparingly.   Can be better to use CSS for this purpose.  Note the better way to write
  for legacy browsers is <br />.
