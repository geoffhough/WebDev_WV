    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>

      This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure
      of what is being <br />
      written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings)
    </p>
    <p>What should this be?</p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading?
      Probably not. Too much info/text now. right?
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>And Another Sub-Heading</h3>
    <p>
      More headings?? Here you can see <em>another</em> sub-heading. You know
      what to do now. Let's use a proper tag.
    </p>
    <h4>Yet Another Sub-Heading</h4>
    <p>
      That's a lot of headings. Here you can see another sub-heading. You know
      what to do now. Make this <strong>WORD</strong> strong aka bold. Give it a
      proper tag!

This is the Main Heading
This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.

<-- add a long line here ->

This is a Sub-Heading

the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or
lower-level headings)

What should this be?

Another Sub-Heading
Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading? Probably not. Too much
info/text now. right?

<-- add a few "breaks" here to create some space! **hint** you can also use these to break sentences into new lines... as it was intended to be used! try using one in the middle of a paragraph and see what happens in your browser->

You know what to do now. Let's use a proper tag. 

Yet Another Sub-Heading
