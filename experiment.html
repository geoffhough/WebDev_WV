<html>
  <head>
    some random text written between the "head" tags.
    <title>title bar or browser tab text</title>
    is this allowed?  apparently so.
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the main heading H1.  Pretty big, eh?</h1>
    <p>this text represents a paragraph of text</p>
    <h1>Another heading</h1>
    <h2>this is a sub-heading because is smaller text h2</h2>
    <h6>this is another sub-heading (h6), the smallest sub-heading?</h6>
    <p>
      this is paragraph text blah blah blah, strange that this text is bigger
      than the sub-heading text.
    </p>
    <p>some more text</p>
  </body>
