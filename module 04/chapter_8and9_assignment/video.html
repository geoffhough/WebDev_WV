      Check out this video where Guile's theme is played on the ukulele. <br />
      If you prefer not to watch the video, then you can just listen to it too!

      Well that's enough music for now. Let's go back to the
      <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- 2nd page

aboutMe.html -- All we need is a <h1> tag that says "About Me",
   a "Email me here" that uses the "mailto:emailName@email.com",
    and has a <a> tag with a proper href in it. For returning back
       to the home page, in between the <a></a> tag, it should say "Home"
        (so that the word "home" becomes a link and will take me back to your
         home page -- perhaps put a <p> tag around it so it starts on
           a new line OR use a <br /> tag) -- the choice is yours. Just don't
            forget to write something in between the <a> tag, otherwise,
               your link will not appear.  -->
