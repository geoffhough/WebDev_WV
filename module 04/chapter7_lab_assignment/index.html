More Notes: 

YOU ARE ALLOWED TO USE THE SAME CODE FROM THE BOOK! :)

Certain sections will have page numbers as to where the code is found - feel free and use that exact code (unless otherwise written in the comments of the assignment).

You will need to choose how you want to approach each section! Use what you already know while adding
 a few more techniques. If you feel a bit stuck, refer back to the chapter lectures or the book, as this assignment is structured from it. 

The assignment is below!
