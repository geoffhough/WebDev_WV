    <h1>Chapter 13 Takeaways PART ONE</h1>
    <p>
      There are a few key points from Chapter 13 - Boxes. Here are some of them:

      <br /><br />

      Width: use px or % Height: use px or % <br /><br />example:<br /><br />
      div { height: 300px; width: 300px; background-color: #bb'bbaa; }

      <br /><br />

      When using percentages (%) vs. px, your boxes will be more responsive, as
      they change with the re-sizing of your window when it;s enlarged or <br />
      shrunken down. The issue with this, is that it's a bit difficult to
      predict what boxes will look like with resizing. For resizing your boxes
      <br />
      to be "predictable" and following good responsive practices, use "@media"
      and px and rewrite the size of your boxes according to your "conditions"
      <br />
      (i.e @media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px) )

      <br /><br />

      Overflow is great for boxes that have a lot of text but you don't want the
      text to take up your entire page:<br /><br />
      p { overflow: scroll; }

      <br /><br />

      Border, Margin, and Padding -- The two that you will mainly work with are
      Margin and Padding:<br /><br />
      (see page 308 for a good example)<br /><br />
      Margin: Pushing boxes around "externally" on your main page -- essentially
      it allows you to move your box around the entire web page
      <br /><br />Padding: Moving content INSIDE your boxes (examples is are
      they flush again the inner wall of the box -- or do they have a little bit
      of space between the inner edge of the box and themselves?)
      <br /><br />Border: We use this at the moment to see how big our boxes are
      -- use this to so that you can "see" where you're boxes are being placed.
      When you change the size of your border, be sure to use the "box-sizing"
      trick at the top of your CSS file which is:

      <br /><br />

      * { box-sizing: border-box; }

      <br /><br />

      - do remember that the top code DOES NOT cover psuedo elements as seen on
      page 289 - which can be very useful! If you want to make sure they are
      protected from weird sizing issues, use this syntax below instead:
      <br /><br />

      *, ::before, ::after { box-sizing: border-box; }
      <br /><br />

      (Single colon ":" is more compatible with older browsers, and what you see
      above is actually a double colon "::" then the word -- use commas between
      each element to make sure they are separated)

      <br /><br />

      Here is some more info on the box-sizing trick:
      <br /><br />

      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing (Links to an
      external site.)

      <br /><br />

      For Border Width, Style, and Color -- we use the shorthand way of writing
      it: border: width style color; which looks like this below in context:
      border: 2px solid black;

      <br /><br />

      If you want to specify a specific side of the border, use the shorthand
      like this (for example, top and bottom of the border):
      <br /><br />border-top: 2px solid black; border-bottpm: 2px solid black;
      <br /><br />

      With the code above, we will not have sides on our on border, only the top
      and bottom of the border will appear.<br /><br />
      display: inline; This is will turn block-elements into inline-elements<br /><br />
      display: block; This will turn inline-elements into block-elements
      <br /><br />display: inline-block; Turns elements into inline-elements AND
      allows the use of block-elements properties+values. <br /><br />

      For getting a clearer picture of display: inline-block; please visit this
      page:<br /><br />
      https://www.w3schools.com/Css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_inline-block_span1
      (Links to an external site.)

      <br /><br />

      display: none; The element that would be there is hidden AND it's
      placement is no longer recognized as seen on page 317
      <br /><br />visibility: hidden; The element will disappear, but its
      placement on your page will remain (there will be an empty space where the
      element should be).

      <br /><br />

      Box-shadows are great and these two are great examples of its use:<br /><br />
      box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 5px #77777,7; box-shadow: 0 0 10px #77777,7;

      <br /><br />

      Border-radius will be a big one to use for styling purposes. I advise
      getting very familiar with this syntax. Here is a good example of code:<br /><br />
      border-radius: 10px; (all around -- which starts and goes from the top,
      right, bottom, left -- make note that it moves "clockwise")
      <br /><br />border-radius: 10px 60px; <br /><br />(top left, bottom right
      will be 10px)<br /><br />
      (top right and bottom left will be 60px)
