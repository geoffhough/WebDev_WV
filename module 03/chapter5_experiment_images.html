<!--
Take-home ideas from this chapter:

<img src="images/pics.jpg" alt="Theses are a collection of the main pics"  /> 

must use these two attributes in an <img/> tag

src

alt

 

A super important detail that the book doesn't mention in chapter 5 is that you turn your pictures into clickable links!

syntax for something like this would be:

<p>Click on this image</p>

<a href="somewhere.com"><img src="image/cats.jpg"/> </a>

You'll get a chance to try it in your assignment.
