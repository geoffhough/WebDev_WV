    <h1>Let's explore TABLES</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>below we have a 3x3 table.  it has 3 <strong>"tr"</strong> tag pairs. <br>
        and in each "tr" section are 3 <strong>"td"</strong> tag pairs (so 3 columns).
    </p>
<table>
<tr>
    <td> 1A </td>
    <td> 2B </td>
    <td> 3C </td>
</tr>
<tr></tr>
    <td> 2A </td>
    <td> 2B </td>
    <td> 2C </td>
</tr>
<tr></tr>
    <td> 3A </td>
    <td> 3B </td>
    <td> 3C </td>
</tr>
    </table>
    <br>
<p>you can substitue <strong>"th"</strong> tags for "tr" tags, and you <br> will get column and red headings.  </p>

Chapter 6 Tables

 

The main idea here is that you will need to understand how tables are set up. I personally don't use tables often, but that's not to say you might not have a client that needs a lot of data drawn out on their site. Good to know the syntax at the very least. 

<table> (main element that contains the table)

<th> (table header)

<tr> (table row)

<td> (table data)

 

Example code:

<table>

    <tr>

        <th></th>

        <th>Monday</th>

        <th> Tuesday</th>

    </tr>

    <tr>

        <th>12pm</th>

        <td> Workout</td>

    </tr>

</table>
