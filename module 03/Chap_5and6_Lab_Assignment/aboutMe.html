<!-- 2nd page

aboutMe.html -- All we need is a <h1> tag that says "About Me",
   a "Email me here" that uses the "mailto:emailName@email.com",
    and has a <a> tag with a proper href in it. For returning back
       to the home page, in between the <a></a> tag, it should say "Home"
        (so that the word "home" becomes a link and will take me back to your
         home page -- perhaps put a <p> tag around it so it starts on
           a new line OR use a <br /> tag) -- the choice is yours. Just don't
            forget to write something in between the <a> tag, otherwise,
               your link will not appear.  -->
