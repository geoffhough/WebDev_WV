Jump to bottom of Page <!- take your user to the bottom of the page ->

Places I have visited

Here are some images from when I traveled the world. 
These were my top three favorite places. The food was amazing! 
<!- store the images you want to use in a folder called "images" - you 
will need to use an <img href=""/> tag to place them in your document  ->

<!- add a long line here! ->


Favorite Animals

I definitely consider myself a cat person. I love dogs too, 
but I get along better with cats. Here are 2 images of my favorite animals. 

<!- change this to fit the animal you like and add at
 least ONE <figure> and <figcaption> to one of the images, 
  as seen on page 120. You can use that EXACT syntax ->

 Me page. Why? Well... because why not? ;) <!- wrap your <img> tag
  with an <a> tag like this: <a href=""> <img src="" alt=""> </a> ->

Down below is a small table of what I do Monday
 through Wednesday between the hours of 12pm and 5pm 

<!- you can use the example on page 134 as your 
main layout, just be sure to add a bit more to the
 code to make our table here complete ->. 
 
  
 index.html -- this will be the main info page where you
  will do most of your work -- Somewhere on your page, 
  you will have a clickable "About Me" that will send to me 
  to your secondary aboutMe.html page. Details on how to do this 
  are in the Chapter 4 lecture module OR on Page 80 in your book.-->
